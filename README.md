# Business-Insight-360-Project 
AtliQ Hardware is a rapidly growing company that specializes in selling computers and accessories through three main sales channels: retailers, direct sales, and distributors. However, after opening a new store in the U.S., the company faced unexpected losses. These problems were initially spotted using surveys, intuition, and basic Excel analysis. With competitors using strong analytics to drive decisions, AtliQ recognized the urgent need to enhance its own analytics capabilities to stay competitive and grow further.

In response, AtliQ decided to implement Power BI, a business intelligence tool, to improve data-driven decision-making. This project focuses on providing key insights into important business areas like finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain. By using Power BI, the goal is to empower stakeholders with easy-to-understand reports and dashboards that help make informed decisions at all levels of the company.

Tools and Technologies Used:

Power BI: For data visualization and creating interactive reports and dashboards.
MySQL: For managing and retrieving data from the companyâ€™s database.
Excel: For initial data analysis and cleansing.
DAX: For creating custom calculations and business logic in Power BI.
